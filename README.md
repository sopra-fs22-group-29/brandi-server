## Getting started
### Spring Boot

#### Setup with your IDE of choice

Download your IDE of choice: (e.g., [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and make sure Java 15 is installed on your system (for Windows-users, please make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the correct version of Java).

1. File -> Open... -> brandi-server
2. Accept to import the project as a `gradle project`

To build right click the `build.gradle` file and choose `Run Build`

#### VS Code
The following extensions will help you to run it more easily:
-   `pivotal.vscode-spring-boot`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard`
-   `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`
-   `richardwillis.vscode-gradle`

**Note:** You'll need to build the project first with Gradle, just click on the `build` command in the _Gradle Tasks_ extension. Then check the _Spring Boot Dashboard_ extension if it already shows `soprafs22` and hit the play button to start the server. If it doesn't show up, restart VS Code and check again.

### Building with Gradle

You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.
-   macOS: `./gradlew`
-   Linux: `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

More Information about [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/).

#### Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Test

```bash
./gradlew test
```

#### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application
once the content of a file has been changed and you save the file.

Start two terminal windows and run:

`./gradlew build --continuous`

and in the other one:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

`./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`


### Debugging

If something is not working and/or you don't know what is going on. We highly recommend that you use a debugger and step
through the process step-by-step.

To configure a debugger for SpringBoot's Tomcat servlet (i.e. the process you start with `./gradlew bootRun` command),
do the following:

1. Open Tab: **Run**/Edit Configurations
2. Add a new Remote Configuration and name it properly
3. Start the Server in Debug mode: `./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm`
4. Press `Shift + F9` or the use **Run**/Debug"Name of your task"
5. Set breakpoints in the application where you need it
6. Step through the process one step at a time

### Release
The project is automatically deployed after every change of the master branch, therefore we implemented a requirement,
such that each change must first be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer.

## External Dependencies

The project implements the [deckofcardsapi](https://deckofcardsapi.com) to manage the cards used for the game.<br>
Find it on Github: https://github.com/crobertsbmw/deckofcards



## Roadmap
- Exchange a card with your teammate everytime you get 6 cards
- Ranking of all users and played games
- Implement the Joker card
- Alternative game modes:
    - time limited games
    - random actions on board
    - even cooler animations
